# Ex.No.10 Content Creation (Reports, Articles, Case Studies, etc.) Using Prompt Patterns

## NAME: DHAYANITHI S
## Reg. No: 212222060305

## Aim:
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.

## Procedure:
1.	Introduction to Prompt Patterns: Begin by understanding the following prompt patterns:
○	Query Decomposition: Breaking down complex queries into smaller, actionable parts.
○	Decision Making: Asking the model to choose between options or directions.
○	Answer Engineering: Refining outputs by giving detailed instructions on how to structure or format the answer.
○	Fact Check List: Ensuring the content is factually accurate, especially for reports or case studies.
○	Tail Generation: Extending the content logically to create depth in storytelling or analysis.
○	Menu Actions: Presenting multiple action choices and guiding the AI to select one.
○	Semantic Filter: Applying filters to control the tone, style, and accuracy of the content.
2.	Choosing the Content Type: Decide on the type of content you want to create. This could be:
○	Reports (e.g., industry analysis, sustainability reports, etc.)
○	Case Studies (e.g., business solutions, technological innovations)
○	Articles (e.g., opinion pieces, educational articles)
○	Creative Content (e.g., comic book story, short stories, video scripts)
3.	For example, you could choose a business report on market trends, a case study on a successful startup, or even a story-based prompt like creating a fictional world for a comic.
4.	Creating the Prompts:
○	Start with simple prompts to generate initial content.
○	Gradually refine the prompts, moving toward more complex techniques like decision-making (asking the model to pick one of several options), tail generation (extending the narrative), and semantic filtering (adjusting style or tone).
5.	Generating and Refining Outputs: Use the model to generate initial drafts, and then refine the outputs using iterative adjustments:
○	For a report, prompt the model with basic data, then ask for a deeper analysis and insights.
○	For creative content, refine the initial story idea with specific details on characters, settings, or actions.
6.	Review and Evaluation: After generating content, evaluate the outputs for:
○	Coherence: Is the generated content logical and structured?
○	Creativity/Originality: Is the content engaging and fresh?
○	Accuracy: Is the content factually accurate (for reports and case studies)?
○	Tone and Style: Does the content match the intended tone (formal, creative, educational)?

## Prompt Engineering Techniques Used:

| Technique                   | Description                                                                          |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Query Decomposition**     | Break a broad content request into smaller, manageable parts for detailed responses. |
| **Decision-making Prompts** | Use prompts that guide the AI to choose between two or more alternatives.            |
| **Semantic Filtering**      | Add constraints or guidance on the audience, tone, or type of language to be used.   |
| **Stepwise Prompting**      | Build content section-by-section for better control and cohesion.                    |
| **Iterative Refinement**    | Rework or refine drafts with focused follow-up prompts.                              |
## Use Case Demonstrations:

### **Example 1: Case Study (Using Query Decomposition)**

**Prompt Used:**

> "Write a case study about how a local bakery increased its customer base by using Instagram marketing. Include business background, initial problem, strategy adopted, and measurable results."

**Output Summary:**

* Well-structured case study with distinct sections.
* Each part had clarity due to segmented prompting.

**Resulting Headings:**

* Background
* Problem Faced
* Strategy Implemented
* Outcome & Metrics
* Lessons Learned


### **Example 2: Article Writing (Semantic Filtering + Tone Guidance)**

**Prompt Used:**

> "Write an 800-word article for college students on how to avoid burnout during exams. Keep the tone casual and friendly. Use simple language."

**Impact:**

* AI kept the style conversational.
* Included relatable examples and short paragraphs.
* Better engagement due to semantic filtering.

**Section Flow:**

1. Introduction to Exam Stress
2. Recognizing Early Signs of Burnout
3. Practical Tips (e.g., Pomodoro Technique, Breaks)
4. Importance of Sleep and Diet
5. Conclusion with Encouragement


### **Example 3: Comic Script (Decision-making + Creative Structure)**

**Prompt Used:**

> "Create a short 4-panel comic script about a robot trying to understand human jokes. Should it be humorous or emotional?"

**AI Decision Making Interaction:**

* AI asked for tone preference.
* Chose: Humorous.

**Comic Panels Script:**

| Panel | Description                                                                 |
